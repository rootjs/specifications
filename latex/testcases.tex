\chapter{Global testcases}
During the development process we will use Travic CI as a continious integration tool, running at least the following testcases: \\

\begin{longtable}{|p{1cm} | p{15cm}|}
   \hline
  /T10/ & Read all global variables \\
  
  /T20/ & Write to all global variables which are non const \\
  
  /T30/ & Write to all global variables that are const and ensure the correct Exception is thrown \\
  
  /T40/ & Create instances of all classes with a public constructor \\
  
  /T50/ & Call all methods of these Objects with valid parameters, where valid means that the 	datatyppe is correct, a method throwing an exception due to invalid input shall be considered a passed test, a creash due to e.g. invalid memory read shall be considered a fail \\
  
  /T60/ & Read all public member variables of these classes \\
  
  /T70/ & Write to all public member variables of these classes that are non constant \\
  
  /T80/ & Write to all public member variables of these classes that are constant and ensure the correct exception is trhown \\
  
  /T90/ & Create instances of classes with private constructors and ensure the correct Exception is thrown \\
  
  /T100/ &  The same for static members and methods \\
   \hline
\end{longtable}
