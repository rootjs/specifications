During the development process we will use Travic CI as a continious integration tool, running at least the following testcases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Read all global variables
	\item Write to all global variables which are non const
	\item Write to all global variables that are const and ensure the correct Exception is thrown
	\item Create instances of all classes with a public constructor
	\item Call all methods of these Objects with valid parameters, where valid means that the datatyppe is correct, a method throwing an exception due to invalid input shall be considered a passed test, a creash due to e.g. invalid memory read shall be considered a fail
	\item Read all public member variables of these classes
	\item Write to all public member variables of these classes that are non constant
	\item Write to all public member variables of these classes that are constant and ensure the correct exception is trhown
	\item Create instances of classes with private constructors and ensure the correct Exception is thrown
	\item The same for static members and methods
\end{itemize}
