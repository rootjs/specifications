\chapter{Purpose}
\paragraph{Project Goal}
The goal of this project is to create Node.js\textsuperscript{\textregistered}\footnote{\url{https://nodejs.org/}} bindings for
ROOT\footnote{\url{https://root.cern.ch/}}, thanks to which it will become possible to e.g. integrate ROOT into Node-based Web applications.\\
We aim specifically at ROOT 6 because its LLVM-based C++ interpreter Cling offers many advantages over the one available in older ROOT versions.
\section{Must-have criteria}
The bindings should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item work on Linux
	\item allow the user to interact with any ROOT class from the Node.js JavaScript interpreter
	\item accept C++ code for just-in-time compilation
	\item update dynamically following changes to C++ internals
	\item provide asynchronous wrappers for common I/O operations (i.e. file and tree access)
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak[3]

\section{Nice-to-have criteria}
The bindings should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item support the streaming of data in JSON format compatible with JavaScript ROOT
	\item implement a webserver based on node.js to mimic the function of the Root HTTP server
	\item work OS independent (i.e. support Mac OS X, Windows, Linux operating systems)
\end{itemize}

\section{Criteria for demarcation}
The bindings should not:
\begin{itemize}
	\item add any extending functionality to the existing ROOT framework
	\item necessarily support previous ROOT versions
	\item necessarily support future ROOT versions
\end{itemize}
