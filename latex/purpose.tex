\chapter{Purpose}
\paragraph{Project Goal}
The goal of this project is to create Node.js bindings for ROOT, thanks to which it will become possible to e.g. integrate ROOT into Node-based Web applications.
We aim specifically at ROOT 6 because its LLVM-based C++ interpreter Cling offers many advantages over the one available in older ROOT versions.
\section{Must-have criteria}
The bindings should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item work on Linux
	\item allow the user to interact with any ROOT class from the Node.js JavaScript interpreter
	\item accept C++ code for just-in-time compilation
	\item update dynamically following changes to C++ internals
	\item provide asynchronous wrappers for common I/O operations (i.e. file and tree access)
\end{itemize}
\section{Nice-to-have criteria}
The bindings should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item support the streaming of data in JSON format compatible with JavaScript ROOT
	\item work OS independent (i.e. support MAC and Windows operating systems)
\end{itemize}
\section{Criteria for demarcation}
The bindings should not:
\begin{itemize}
	\item add any extending functionality to the existing ROOT framework.
	\item 
\end{itemize}
