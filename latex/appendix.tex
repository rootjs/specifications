\section{Glossary}
\paragraph{Application programming interface (API)}
A collection of tools, libraries and documentation for creating software. APIs expose functionality through specified interfaces, which allows to develop independent from the specific implementation.
\paragraph{Asynchronous IO}
Using asynchronous IO, an application does not have to wait for the data transmission to finish, but can continue in execution. This prevents leaving the CPU idle, as IO operations are usually significantly slower than other tasks.
\paragraph{C++}
It is a general purpose, object oriented programming language and is one of the most widely used programming languages.
\paragraph{Cling}
An interactive C++ interpreter with a command line prompt and uses a just-in-time compiler.
\paragraph{enums}

\paragraph{Google V8 JavaScript}
\paragraph{HTTP}
\paragraph{Input/Output (I/O)}
\paragraph{Interpreter}
\paragraph{JavaScript}
An interpreted programming or script language created by Netscape.
\paragraph{JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)}
A data format which is easy to read and write for humans.
\paragraph{Just-in-time (JIT) compilation}
\paragraph{Language bindings}
Exposes an API to another programming language. This enables usage of low-level functionality in higher-level environments.
\paragraph{Large Hadron Collider (LHC)}
\paragraph{Linux}
A free and open source computer operating system.
\paragraph{Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)}
A compiler infrastructure written in C++.
\paragraph{Mac}
A Unix based operating system created by Apple.
\paragraph{Method overloading}
declaring a method multiple times within the same namespace using different parameters
\paragraph{Method signature}

\paragraph{node.js}
A runtime environment for developing server-side web applications written in Javascript. 

\paragraph{Object}

\paragraph{Operating System}
A piece of software managing software and hardware resources, input/output, and also controls the overall operation of the computer system.
\paragraph{Platform}

\paragraph{ROOT}
A framework for data processing, particularly for particle physicists. ROOT was developed by CERN C++.


\paragraph{RPC}

\paragraph{Stream}

\paragraph{Web server}

\paragraph{Windows}
A DOS based operating system created by Microsoft.
