\chapter{Product data}

The following data will be stored by the rootJS bindings: \\

\begin{longtable}{|p{1cm} | p{15cm}|}
\hline
/D10/ & All ROOT classes and methods with corresponding signatures as they are dynamically mapped to JavaScript equivalents. They are also needed to support C/C++ specific features such as method overloading.\\
\hline
/D20/ & The ROOT environment state is preserved between calls from Node.js. This means that objects and variables are available until the rootJS session has ended or a reset was triggered explicitly.\\
\hline
/D30/ & The application context derived from \textit{TApplication}\footnote{\url{https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTApplication.html}}, storing at least the program name and path.\\
\hline
/D40/ & A map of \textit{v8::handle}'s\footnote{\url{http://izs.me/v8-docs/classv8_1_1Handle.html}} identified by the address of ROOT objects will be stored to allow proper handling of cyclic references, because the data is used to provide a cache that prevents stepping down in the recursive (object) creation endlessly.\\
