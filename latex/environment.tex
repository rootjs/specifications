\paragraph{Providing ROOT to Node.js}
\noindent Node.js bindings for ROOT simplify the creation of client-server based ROOT applications. The bindings offer solutions based on state of the art web technology, especially the separation of data processing and visualization.\\

\section{Software}
\subsection{ROOT}

ROOT is a software framework for data analysis and I/O. It can be used to process and especially visualize large amounts of scientific data, e.g. the petabytes of data recorded by the Large Hadron Collider experiments every year.\\
Since the framework comes with an interpreter for the C++ programming language it can be used for rapid and efficient prototyping. It also features a persistency mechanism for C++ objects. Therefore ROOT based applications are extensible and as feature rich as the C++ language itself.
A detailed introduction to the ROOT framework can be found in the \textit{ROOT  primer}\footnote[1]{\url{https://root.cern.ch/root/html534/guides/primer/ROOTPrimer.html}}
on the CERN website. \\ \\
Interfacing with ROOT is done dynamically, since ROOT shares all the necessary information in its (global) functions during runtime.

\subsection{Node.js}

Node.js is an open source runtime environment. It is used to develop server-side web applications and may act as a stand alone web server. It uses the Google V8 engine to execute JavaScript code. \\ \\
The rootJS binding-API will be developed as a so called native Node.js module written in C++. It interfaces directly with the V8 API to provide (non-blocking) encapsulation of ROOT objects as JavaScript equivalents.

\section{Hardware}

The bindings simply provide data structures for the encapsulation of ROOT objects and functions. Hence the additional hardware requirements of the bindings themselves 
should be negligible compared to ROOT's.\\ \\
Calling a ROOT function via the binding-API inside a Node.js application will take up a minimal amount of additional resources compared to a direct function call inside a native ROOT application.
In conclusion, there are no additional hardware requirements for using the bindings on a computer which was able to run native ROOT applications before - this includes almost any modern Desktop PC.
