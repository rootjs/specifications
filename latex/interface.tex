\chapter{Product interface and functions}
The rootJS bindings will not have a user interface, neither a graphical user interface nor a command line interface.
This section will therefore specify the API of rootJS.


\begin{longtable}{|p{1cm} | p{15cm}|}
   \hline
  /I10/ & The module will expose a JavaScript object containing all accessible root variables, functions and classes \\
  \hline
  /I20/ & Exposed variables might contain scalar values, in this case they will be accessible in their JavaScript counterparts \\
  \hline
  /I30/ & Exposed variables might be objects, which are recursively converted to JavaScript objects until there are only scalar values \\
  \hline
  /I40/ & Exposed variables might be enums. In this case the identifier of the currently selected value is returned instead of the corresponding integer \\
  \hline
  /I50/ & Every exposed method will be accessible via a proxy method which handles parameter overloading, as JavaScript does not support overloading. If there is no method to handle the passed arguments, an exception will be thrown \\
  \hline
  /I55/ & A method can be called with an additional callback method that will be called after the original method has been executed \\
  \hline
  /I60/ & Exposed classes will be accessible as a constructor returning the object. The constructor will be proxied to support parameter overloading. If there is no method to handle the passed arguments, an exception will be thrown  \\
  \hline
  /I65/ & A constructor can be called with an additional callback method that will be called after the object has been constructed \\
  \hline
  /I70/ & The classes are encapsulated in their namespaces from ROOT. Each namespace is an Object containing namespaces or class constructors \\
  \hline
  /I80/ & Exceptions thrown by Root will be forwarded to JavaScript and can be treated by JavaScript as normal exceptions \\
  \hline
  /I90/ & Global variables are accessible via getter and setter methods to ensure their values are kept in sync with the ROOT framework \\
   \hline
