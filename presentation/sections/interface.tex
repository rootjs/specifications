\begin{frame}{Product interface and functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Expose a JS object containing all accessible ROOT variables, functions and classes.\\
    \begin{itemize}
      \item variables
      \item functions
      \item classes
    \end{itemize}
  \item Exposed classes will be accessible via constructors returning the corresponding objects. A constructor will be accessible through a proxy function to support parameter overloading. If there is no method to handle the passed arguments, an exception will be thrown.\\
  \item A constructor can be called with an additional callback method that will be executed after the object has been constructed.\\
  \item The classes are encapsulated in their namespaces from ROOT. Each namespace is an object containing namespaces or class constructors.\\
  \item Exceptions thrown by ROOT will be forwarded to JavaScript and can be treated as normal exceptions by JavaScript.\\
  \item Global variables are accessible via getter and setter methods to ensure their values are kept in sync with the ROOT framework.\\
\end{itemize}
