\section{System Model}
\subsection{Initialization}
\begin{frame}{Initialization}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Expose all
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Global variables
      \item Global functions
      \item Classes
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \item Each are bound to corresponding proxy methods
    \item An object which members are the exposed features is beeing passed to node
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{Names}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Functions and classes have the same name as in Root
      \item Global variables can be called using Get[Variable] and Set[Variable] methods
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Call a feature}
\begin{frame}{Call a feature}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All features in node are mapped to a proxy method that will be called
    \pause
    \item The proxy method will eventually call a root function and pass the result to our ObjectFactory
    \pause
    \item By looking at the object type an corresponding v8::Handle will be generated and returned to node
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If the result is an object this will be done recursively
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
