  \begin{itemize}
    \item Make sure all elements are callable without crashing
    \item To verify results of function calls and calculations, we would need to run ROOT's testcases
    \item Porting all ROOT testcases would make no sense!
    \item Only port a subset to make sure the bindings are working and leave the rest to the ROOT developers
  \end{itemize}
